## Overarching goal
- **Rubin causal model.** Establish a rigorous framework for evaluating and understanding causality
]
???

So this is kind of the roadmap of where we want to be by the end of the two days. First, the overarching goals of the workshop. Causal inference is a huge field with lots of different approaches and we can't cover it all, but we want to hit the main points that will be most useful for data science. First, we want to establish a foundation in the Rubin causal model or the **counterfactual model** / **potential outcomes model**, which is by far the most popular causal framework in social science. It's not the only one, but it is the one that is most commonly used for observational data. **NEXT SLIDE**

Then, within this framework, we will talk about the ideal situation. Like all frameworks and models, there are fundamental assumptions that must be met for us to make valid inference. So as a starting point, we'll go over an experimental design which is when these assumptions are guaranteed to be met. This will help us understand why experiments and RCTs are considered the gold standard and why all our analytical and design-based methods are focused on trying to mimic an RCT. **NEXT SLIDE**

Then we'll start to chip away at the assumptions. The RCM is most powerful in observational data when you don't have all these assumptions guaranteed. How do your results get biased and what can you do about it? **NEXT SLIDE**

Finally, we'll spend a little bit today and all of tomorrow going over ways we can address these biases using analytical methods. It will be more applied and interactive with thought experiments. (NOTE: We could address many of these using design-based methods, but we likely won't have time to go over that and it's not often you get to design studies as a data scientist.)

]
???
So for today, we're going to do four talks. First, we're going to make sure we are all on the same page about what causal inference is within this same framework. **NEXT SLIDE**

Second, within this framework, let's talk about estimating a causal effect in a best case scenario and go over ways we can explicitly state our causal assumptions using graphical diagrams. **NEXT SLIDE**

Third, we'll talk about different obstacles to estimating causal effects. In the real world setting a randomized control trial is often not feasible or ethical so what can we do to ensure we aren't breaking the assumptions of our framework? Or what can we do when we can't confirm we meet the assumptions? How can we get close? **NEXT SLIDE**

And then we'll introduce a method to overcome some of these obstacles called instrumental variables and talk about how it attempts to mimic an RCT.

## Introduction to Causal Inference
- **Motivation.** Why do we care about causal inference at all?
]

???

Ok. Are there any questions about today or the overarching theme of the workshop? Let's get started. I'm going to mainly talk about why we care about causal inference, define some things to make sure we are all talking about the same thing, and then give you a framework to think about causal effects.

# Motivation
## Why do we care about causal inference at all?
???
So why do we even care about causal inference? Obviously, you guys care because you're here, but why should data scientists in general care about causal inference? 

---
# Almost all questions we care about are *causal* questions

???

Well, the simple answer is that most of the questions we are interested in are causal questions. 

Right? If you work for the government and you want to reduce poverty, you want to know what happens to poverty when you give out cash transfers? What happens to the employment rate when you change the minimum wage? If you live in a city with gun violence, will increasing gun restrictions help to lower the violence? 

If I change `\(x\)` will that change `\(y\)`. 

Yet our tools are correlation based. And no matter how much data you have, it will always be association or correlation based. Big data doesn't change this. There was and still is this notion that if you have enough data, you can figure out how things work, and we don't think that's true. We think causal inference will help you make good causal decisions within data science.

--

1. What is the effect of Drug B on the population?

1. How will increasing minimum wage affect the employment rate?

1. Do unconditional cash transfer programs help relieve poverty?

1. Will stricter gun laws reduce gun-related homocide?

In other words, he believes we are collecting so much data that soon correlation is all you'll need. This obviously ignores issues of how you're collecting the data, the quality of the data, selection of people generating the data, and the like, but on top of that, it just disregards causal inference entirely.

Does an increase in spending on keyword advertisements increase my return?
]

???

So here's an example of when causal inference shows you something has gone wrong. This is a pretty famous ebay example that came out in 2015 and one of the data scientists at eBay wanted to know if it was worth it to spend money on keyword advertisements. So those little ads on the side that pop up in google or whatever when people search for certain terms. **NEXT SLIDE**

Now all prior information would indicate that keyword ads are highly effective. You are, after all, targeting only people who are interested in something you have to offer.**NEXT SLIDE**

All predictive modeling suggests there's a huge correlation between people who click on those ads and end up buying something.**NEXT SLIDE**

]

???
So the statistical question has been answered. Is clicking on a keyword ad associated with buying something? Yes. But the causal question is different. Compared to not using keyword ads, how much does using keyword ads affect my revenue? **NEXT SLIDE**

So they stopped advertising on two search engines but kept advertising on one and they kept track of what people did once they clicked through via these different search engiens. **NEXT SLIDE**

They found that almost everybody, like 99.5%, would eventually find the ad through unpaid searchers. Some other studies suggested returns were negative — that is, they spent more on the ads than the .5% were spending on their site.

## Hormone replacement therapy
In 1990's, HRT was incredily popular medication for women.
]

???

Ok. So that's a cute little example, but bad causal inference also has pretty serious consequences. Back in the 90s, there was a treatment called hormone replacement therapy for women who had reached menopause. So when you hit menopause, there's a shift in your estrogen and testosterone levels and the idea was you could replace these hormones and hopefully see positive health effects. **NEXT SLIDE**

So all observational studies, including NHS, indicated HRT was really good. It reduced levels of heart disease by 35-45% and in public health 2-3% if really good. You're taking about millions of people so even tiny positive effects are really good overall. **NEXT SLIDE**

But then in the late 90s and early 00s, two RCTs came out and found that RCT increased CVD risk. **NEXT SLIDE**

???

And not by a small amount. It significantly increased CVD risk. **NEXT SLIDE**

We now recognize the short comings of the observational data, but the result was a huge debate in public health about whether or not we should be using observational data at all. **NEXT SLIDE**

On the plus side, Hernan et al showed that proper analysis with good domain knowledge could have led to the right result using observational data. **NEXT SLIDE**

# Definition
## What is causal inference?

???

Not going to keep you in suspense. Let's just define it and then we will break it down.

# Causal inference is the process of estimating a comparison of counterfactual or potential outcomes under different treatment conditions on the same set of units.

.right-column[
## Causal Inference and Prediction

- Both causal inference and prediction use associational models but goals are different
]

???

So first I want to highlight how this is different from prediction. Causal inference is interested in cmoparing these counterfactuals on the same set of units. It wants to know what would have happened to the same units if instead of this, something else happened. 

Now both causal inference and prediction use the same models, but the goals are very different. **NEXT SLIDE**

Right? In prediction, you only care about how accurate you can be at predicting some out of sample `\(y\)`. We only care about maximizing that ability. Given some set of inputs, how do I estimate `\(y\)` with minimal error. **NEXT SLIDE**

In contrast, causal inference cares about manipulation on the same person. We want an unbiased estimate of if I change x, what would happen to y. **NEXT SLIDE**

One easy example is carrying matches in your pocket and lung cancer. Turns out that carrying matches is highly predictive of lung cancer risk. If all you care about is finding people who have lung cancer or predicting who will have lung cancer, this is enough data for you. However, people who carry matches are more likely to smoke and smoking causes lung cancer. If you want to reduce the chances of somebody getting lung cancer, you can't just say "don't carry matches", you need to know the causal pathway and reduce smoking.

If Edward takes Drug B and get a headache, did Drug B *cause* his headache?
]

???

Ok. So we are focused on causal inference in this workshop. But first, let's ask what is a causal effect?

What do we mean when we say something *caused* something else? We intuitively understand but what do we mean explicitly? Let's pretend Edward take a Drug and gets a headache. Did the Drug cause my headache?

It only caused my headache if we knew I wouldn't have gotten the headache, had I not taken the drug. **NEXT SLIDE**

Right? If Eddie would have gotten the headache anyways, then the drug did not cause his headache. **NEXT SLIDE**

So we are comparing two scenarios on the same person. One in which Eddie takes the drug and one in which he doesn't. If you somehow could see the two outcomes of the same exact person, you'd be able to estimate a causal effect. **NEXT SLIDE**
--
.right-column[
Implicitly, Drug B only caused the headache if Eddie would *not* have received the headache if Eddie had not taken Drug B.
]
--
.right-column[
So a causal effect is a comparison of two *potential outcomes* (or *counterfactuals*) on a unit (or a single set of units). Importantly, we only observe **one** outcome so all comparisons are hypothetical.

.right-column[
## Rubin Causal Model
- This framework of *counterfactual* or *potential outcomes* is the basis of the Rubin causal model. 
]

???

So this idea of counterfactuals is really important. It's the centerpiece of the Rubin causal model. **NEXT SLIDE** 

It's what separates RCM from many other frameworks of causality. **NEXT SLIDE** 

Further, it is what allows us to estimate causal effects in observational data. **NEXT SLIDE** 
--

.right-column[
- Counterfactual thinking separates the Rubin causal model from other causal frameworks like Bradford-Hill, Rothman, or Koch's postulates. 
]
--
.right-column[
- Unlike the other frameworks, the counterfactuals allow us to make causal statements using observational data.
]
---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Causal Inference

  ### Rubin causal model
]
.right-column[
## Counterfactuals

So, we define our counterfactuals: 
- Let `\(A\)` be a binary treatment with `\(1\)` indicating the drug is taken and `\(0\)` otherwise
- `\(Y^{a=0}\)` is the outcome if Eddie had *not* taken the drug 
- `\(Y^{a=1}\)` is the outcome if Eddie *had* taken the drug
]

???

So let's formalize this with a little bit of notation.

Some people prefer **potential outcomes** to emphasize that two different outcomes could potentially be observed depending on the treatment while others prefer **counterfactuals** to emphasize that each outcome represents situations that may not actually occur. 

Let A be a binary treatment where 1 indicates you received treatment and 0 indicates you did not. Then Y^{a=1} is your potential outcome if you receive treatment and Y^{a=0} is your potential outcome if you did not. **NEXT SLIDE** 

Then, your causal effect exists only if those two things are different, right? **NEXT SLIDE** 

And if it exists, we can estiamte it by taking the different between the two (or the ratio or the odds ratio). 
--
.right-column[
Then, Drug B has a causal effect if and only if `\(Y^{a=0}\neq Y^{a=1}\)`

Ok. So this is what the data we want look like. It's the data we would have on every single person if we could somehow know what would happen to that exact person at that exact time under two different treatments. **NEXT SLIDE** 

Clearly, this is not possible in reality. Even if we use the same person, we are using different times. Maybe the second time, Eddie drinks more water so he is more hydrated and that's why he doesn't get a headache. Who knows? **NEXT SLIDE**

This is the data we actually observe. We don't know what his potential outcome was if he did not take the drug, but if we assume something called consistency, we can pretend that his potential outcome given he did take the drug is what we observed since we observed he did not take the drug. **NEXT SLIDE** 

This brings us to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Namely, we can never observe both potential outcomes and thus individual causal effects can never be estimated. **NEXT SLIDE**

## Caveat about Rubin Causal Model

- Despite how it will feel when reading the literature, this is **not the only framework** of causal inference. 

--

- It is a very useful framework. But also limited — especially when evaluating things with no well-defined intervention. (For example, "Does obesity increase the risk of premature mortality?")

--

- Still an active debate. For an example, see debate in epidemiology between Nancy Krieger.red[*] et al. and Jamie Robins et al.
